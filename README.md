[Hamburger Menu](https://github.com/cssmenumaker/jQuery-Plugin-Responsive-Drop-Down)
This plugin created a hamburger menu when the page is minimized or at a mobile size. 

[Photo Slider](http://www.jqueryscript.net/slider/Responsive-Infinite-Carousel-with-jQuery-CSS3.html)
This plugin is on the front page of my website. It acts as a responsive nonstop photo "carousel" which contains images of the food. 

[PDF form host](http://www.thedaydreamerdesigns.com/)
This plugin is found on the wine page. It contains a PDF of the wines which would ideally be easily updated whenever new wines were imported. Unfortunately the plugin did not come with a ReadMe where I could center it better, as oppose to it being left justified.  

Notes: 
-My dev tools kept bringing up errors for the winelist script. I tried to remove it, but it removes the entire PDF plugin. (It says "media is not a function"). Additionally the plug in works on all browsers with the exception of Chrome. 

-The carousel is also coming up as an error although it is necessary for the slider to operate. 

-My dish of the day is on the food page, there is a link to the Gusteau FB on promotions
